## Overview
Most websites and web applications require the development of both client-side and server-side technologies. Client-side (or front-end) refers to those technologies that run in the web browser like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Server-side (or back-end) refers to those technologies that run on a server. For your final project we will create our own custom blogging engine.

You are going to write a simple blogging engine. Your blog will need to support the following features:

- Display all the current blog entries
- Create a new blog entry
- Edit an existing blog entry
- Delete blog posts
- Store your blog entries in a database
- (optional) Implement authentication
### Navigation
If you have multiple pages each page will have consistent navigation. If it is a single page app then make sure that you have a clear and easy way to navigate your page.

### Style
We are going to write our own style sheet that will have at least 10 CSS rules to make our site look fancy!

### Persistence
You will need to leverage a database to store your entries.

### Frameworks
This project will not use any front end frameworks, everything will be built from scratch.

# Checkpoint 1 - Basic Design
On this checkpoint you will create the design of your website. You can use any design tool you wish or you can do your design using pen and paper! This is just a rough guide so you know how to get started.

## Deliverables
A design that you plan to implement. Add the design to the root folder in your repo and name it **my-design.pdf**

# Checkpoint 2 - Basic database working
At this checkpoint we will need to have a basic database working that can store your blog entires. You can hard code entries for now to get yourself started!

## Deliverables
A working database that can Create and Read basic entries.

# Checkpoint 3 - New/Edit/Update Features
At this checkpoint our app will allow you to create a new blog post and edit and update existing blog posts.

## Deliverables
Basic Create and Update functionality that is not hardcoded into your app.

# Checkpoint 4 - UI Flair
Add some UI Flair! You are free to explore this as you wish make it as fancy as you want!

## Deliverables
Some CSS to make your website fancy!
