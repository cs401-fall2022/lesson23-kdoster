## Experience

Doing the CSS was a little tricky for me, as I am not super creative, and it's been a month or two since we've done CSS. Figuring out exactly how the routing worked also took a little time. A little more explanation into that as well as sanitizing db input would've been nice.

## Known issues or Bugs

Hasn't been tested in a while, but putting in an apostrophe (') might crash the site due to unsanitized input.

## Sources used

I used the textbook and the express website for help.
